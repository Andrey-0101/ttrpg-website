## Purpose

This document records the implemented user-facing route and navigation structure.

It does not describe unimplemented dice, video, handout, NPC, session, notes, Public Readiness, or Call of Cthulhu routes as current.

## Current primary navigation

Authenticated navigation includes:

- Home;
- Games;
- Dashboard;
- Campaigns;
- Characters;
- account area;
- language switcher.

The Dashboard is an accepted implemented personal overview route. It currently links to Campaigns and Characters and may expand later.

```

`loading.tsx` and `not-found.tsx` are framework route-state files, not literal URL segments.

## Public and authentication areas

### Home

```text
/[locale]
```

Current localized landing page.

```text

```

Current integrated workspace sections:

- invitations for GM;
- Game Master and Player list;
- Player leave and GM removal;
- linked characters;
- owned eligible character linking;
- campaign counts and navigation;
- completion and deletion;
- loading and unavailable states.

The current foundation intentionally keeps these controls on the overview route rather than creating separate Members, Characters, or Settings routes.

## Current authorization shape

| Area | Current access |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | authenticated user |
| My Characters | authenticated owner |
| Character edit/delete | owner only |
| Campaign shared character | active campaign GM or Player; read only |
| My Campaigns | authenticated participant |
| Campaign Overview | campaign GM or active Player |
| Invitation management | GM only |
| Accept invitation | authenticated valid token holder |
| Remove Player | GM only |
| Leave campaign | current Player |
| Campaign edit/complete/delete | GM only |
| Profile edit | self only |

RLS and Storage policies remain authoritative.

## Current limitations

Not implemented:

- personal dice roller;
- shared campaign dice;
- persisted roll history;
- realtime dice feed;
- video rooms;
- handouts;
- NPCs;
- sessions/Chronicle;
- campaign notes;
- public character pages;
- Public Readiness routes;
- Call of Cthulhu character support.

## Current structural conclusion

The site is now a bilingual private VtM character and campaign manager.

It has a working shared authorization boundary and is ready for the next sequence:

1. personal VtM dice engine and roller;
2. persisted shared campaign dice;
3. managed-video spike and minimal campaign video room;
4. remaining friend campaign workspace.
